**_Pragati_** is a cultural extravaganza, that brings together the faculty, staff and students of SCTIMST, Trivandrum. True to its name, **_Pragati_** is much more than just a display of arts and talent. It stands for the prosperity and growth of the Sree Chitra as a community!

**_Pragati_**, will be a melting pot of shared joy and experience, where everyone comes together as one, to revel in this extraordinary series of events, that will leave us all spellbound, with a new sense of learning, solidarity and memories to be treasured. 

Lets make it happen!
See you there!
